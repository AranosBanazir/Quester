  ## Tools and 3rd party assistance
  * Built with React, MongoDb, Express, Node, Apollo, Graphql, Tailwind, DaisyUi
  * Images generated from canva.com 

  ## Obstacles and Successes
  * Creating a React app using technologies a couple of us weren't versed in.
  * Creating a seemless Authentication app that checks if the parent or child is logged in and displays a page based on the user.
  * Getting tasks and rewards to display on both pages and updating the database when one side of the equation was redeemed. 

 
  * Successes were that we thought of the app quickly even if we didn't know how to do it and created wireframes to get a visual of what to build

  * Nifty navigation setup to again check who is viewing and routing to the correct page. 

  * Caleb provided all of the backend data handling Schema, Seeds, TypeDefs, Resolvers, Mutations etc and excelled at it. 

  * Creating components went smooth throughout the process and adding polish and animations made the app come to life.
